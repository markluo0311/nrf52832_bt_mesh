# Serial Event Overview {#serial-events}

Serial Events are messages sent from the nRF5 to the host controller. Messages
are either sent asynchronously as a result of some interaction in the mesh or
as a response to a command.

See the table below for an overview over the various events pushed by the nRF5
to the host. Each entry links to their respective "Details" section, where the
parameters and reason for each event are described.

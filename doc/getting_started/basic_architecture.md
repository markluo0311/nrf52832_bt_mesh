# The mesh architecture

The mesh stack consists of a number of subsystems that are interfaced through a set of API modules. The API modules hide the complexity of their subsystems. The functionality provided in the API is sufficient to make a functioning mesh device, so that there is no need to bypass the API.

The mesh stack's structure is based off the structure of the Bluetooth Mesh Specification and follows the same naming conventions. See [Basic Bluetooth Mesh concepts](@ref md_doc_getting_started_basic_concepts) for an introduction to the Bluetooth Mesh.

## Overview

 ![Basic Mesh architecture](img/basic_architecture.svg)

- **Models**: The Bluetooth Mesh models present and implement device behavior.
- **Access**: The Bluetooth Mesh access layer organizes models and communication.
- **DSM**: The Device State Manager stores addresses and encryption keys for usage in the models.
- **Core**: The Core Bluetooth Mesh layer takes care of encryption and message relaying.
- **Provisioning**: The Bluetooth Mesh provisioning protocol is used for adding devices to the network.
- **Bearer**: The Bearer layer takes care of low-level radio operation.
- **DFU**: The Device Firmware Upgrade module cooperates with a bootloader to enable firmware upgrades through the mesh.
- **Node Config** (not pictured): The node configuration is a utility module that manages the configuration and setup of the device.
- **Serial** (not pictured): Application-level serialization of the Mesh API allows the mesh to be controlled by a separate host device.

## Models

The models define the behavior and communication formats of all data that is transmitted across the mesh. Equivalent to Bluetooth low energy's GATT services, the Mesh Models are independent, immutable implementations of specific behaviors or services. All mesh communication happens through models, and any application that exposes its behavior through the mesh must channel the communication through one or more models.

The Bluetooth Mesh Specification defines a set of immutable models for typical usage scenarios, but vendors are also free to implement their own models.

You can read more about how to implement your own models in [Creating custom models](@ref md_doc_getting_started_how_to_models).

## Access

*API: access.h*

The access layer controls the device's model composition. It holds references to the models that are present on the device, the messages these models accept, and the configuration of these models. As the device receives mesh messages, the access layer finds which models the messages are for and forwards them to the model implementations.

## Device State Manager

*API: device_state_manager.h*

The Device State Manager stores the encryption keys and addresses used by the mesh stack. When models are assigned application keys and publish addresses through configuration, the Device State Manager stores the raw values and provides handles for the models to use when referencing these values.

The Device State Manager stores its data in persistent storage, which it can recover on bootup.

## Mesh Core

*API: nrf_mesh.h*

Consisting of a network and a transport layer, the Mesh Core module provides the mesh-specific transport for the messages.

The transport layer provides in-network security by encrypting mesh packets with _application keys_ and splitting them into smaller segments that can go on air. The transport layer re-assembles incoming packet segments and presents the full mesh message to the access layer.

The network layer encrypts each transport layer packet segment with a _network key_ and populates the source and destination address fields. When receiving a mesh packet, the network layer decrypts the message, inspects the source and destination addresses, and decides whether the packet is intended for this device and whether the network layer should relay it.

The Mesh Core provides protection against malicious behavior and attacks against the mesh network through two-layer encryption, replay protection, and packet header obfuscation.

## Provisioning

*API: nrf_mesh_prov.h*

Provisioning is the act of adding a device to a mesh network. The Provisioning module takes care of both sides of this process, by implementing a provisioner role (the network owner) and a provisionee role (the device to add).

To participate in mesh communication, each device must be provisioned. Through the provisioning process, the new device receives a range of addresses, a network key, and a device key.

The mesh stack provides two ways to provision a device: Directly through the PB-ADV provisioning bearer, or through remote provisioning. The PB-ADV provisioning can only happen between a provisioner and a provisionee that are within radio range of each other, while remote provisioning implements two mesh models that together create a tunnel through the mesh, allowing the provisioner to add devices from a distance, with the help of a PB-ADV proxy device.

> **Important:** The remote provisioning is a Nordic proprietary feature that cannot be used with devices from other vendors.

The Remote Provisioning [Client](@ref md_examples_pb_remote_client_README) and [Server](@ref md_examples_pb_remote_server_README) examples demonstrate remote provisioning. The [light control example](@ref md_examples_light_control_README) shows the provisioner and provisionee side of PB-ADV as a first step to establishing the network.

For a detailed guide on how to use provisioning, see [mesh provisioning](@ref md_doc_getting_started_provisioning).

## Bearer

The Bearer is the low-level radio controller and provides an asynchronous interface to the radio packet sending and receiving for the upper layers. It enforces Bluetooth low energy compliance for packet formats and timing and operates directly on radio hardware through the @link_ic_SDtimeslotAPI<!--SoftDevice Timeslot API: http://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/com.nordic.infocenter.s132.sds/dita/softdevices/s130/concurrent_multiprotocol_tsl_api/concurrent_multiprotocol_tsl_api.html-->.

The Bearer is an internal module that normally does not need to be accessed by the application.

## DFU

*API: nrf_mesh_dfu.h*

The Device Firmware Upgrade module provides firmware update capabilities over the mesh by cooperating with a bootloader. It is capable of concurrent, authenticated firmware transfers to all devices in a network, without halting the application.

The DFU procedure and protocol is shared with the @link_openmesh<!--nRF OpenMesh: https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF51-ble-bcast-mesh-->. It is not compatible with the Bluetooth low energy secure DFU procedure used in the nRF5 SDK.

> **Important:** The mesh DFU is a Nordic proprietary feature that cannot be used with devices from other vendors.

For more information about the DFU procedure, visit the @link_openmeshrepo <!--nRF OpenMesh repository: https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF51-ble-bcast-mesh/tree/master/nRF51/bootloader--> or see the [quick start guide](@ref md_doc_getting_started_dfu_quick_start).

## Node Config

*API: nrf_mesh_node_config.h*

The Node Configuration module is a thin wrapper around the top-level mesh modules that makes it easy to get started using the mesh. It takes care of mesh initialization and starts the provisionee role, requesting to be added to a network. The Node Configuration module is the easiest way to get a new mesh device up and running, but it hides some of the more complex features and use-cases for the mesh device startup.

## Serial

*API: nrf_mesh_serial.h*

The Serial module provides full serialization of the mesh API, allowing other devices to control the nRF5 mesh device through a UART interface. Intended for network gateways and similar complex applications, the serial interface provides a way to access the mesh through a Nordic device, without making it the unit's main controller.

The mesh serial interface is based on the @link_nRF8001 <!--nRF8001: http://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-low-energy/nRF8001--> ACI serial interface and optionally supports @link_SLIP<!--SLIP: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Line_Internet_Protocol-->-encoded operation. The serial protocol can be run as a stand-alone application (see the [serial example](@ref md_examples_serial_README)) or alongside a normal mesh application.

An overview of the serial packet format, commands, and events can be found in the [serial documentation](@ref md_doc_libraries_serial).

# Remote provisioning server example

This example demonstrates how the client can use a remote provisioning server as a relay for provisioning nodes that it cannot reach directly.

For more information about remote provisioning, see the
[PB-remote API reference](@ref PB_REMOTE).

The example application starts out as a normal provisionee. It
starts acting as a remote provisioning server only after it has been
provisioned into a network.

To use this example application with the client example application,
flash one device swith the client application and two or
more devices with the server application. See 
the [client documentation](@ref md_examples_pb_remote_client_README) for
more information.

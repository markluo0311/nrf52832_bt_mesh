/**
 * @defgroup MULTI_STAGE_QUEUE Multi stage queue module
 * Generic Multi stage FIFO queue for set size objects.
 *
 * The Multistage queue operates very similarly to the @c fifo_t queue, with three distictions:
 * - It does not do any IRQ locking, and assumes that each "stage" in the queue is operated from a
 *   single context.
 * - It does not do any copying, but instead provides pointers directly into the queue buffer.
 * - The multistage queue operates in N stages, where each stage is an index in the queue. This
 *   allows the user to process elements in a pipeline-like manner, where each stage processes an
 *   element, before making it available to the next. Stage 0 is the head of the pipeline, while
 *   the last stage is the tail.
 * Example usage:
 * @code{c}
    void set_value(void)
    {
        uint32_t * p_integer = msq_get(&m_queue, 0);
        *p_integer = 42;
        msq_move(&queue, 0);
    }

    uint32_t get_value(void)
    {
        uint32_t * p_integer = msq_get(&m_queue, 1);
        uint32_t retval = *p_integer;
        msq_move(&queue, 1);
        return retval;
    }
